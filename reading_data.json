    "passage": "★★★★☆ The Garden Bistro - A Hidden Gem in Downtown\n\nReviewed by Emily Torres, Food Critic\nPublished: June 15, 2025\n\nTucked away on a quiet side street, The Garden Bistro offers an intimate dining experience that perfectly balances elegant ambiance with approachable cuisine. Chef Maria Santos has created a menu that celebrates seasonal ingredients while maintaining consistent quality across all dishes.\n\nThe restaurant's signature dish, herb-crusted salmon with quinoa pilaf, was expertly prepared and beautifully presented. The flavors were well-balanced, though the portion size felt slightly small for the $28 price point. The roasted vegetable medley that accompanied the dish showcased the chef's commitment to using locally-sourced produce.\n\nService was attentive but not intrusive, with our server providing excellent wine recommendations that complemented our meal perfectly. The atmosphere struck the right note for both business dinners and romantic evenings.\n\nMy only complaint was the limited parking availability, which required us to park three blocks away. Despite this minor inconvenience, I would definitely return and recommend The Garden Bistro to anyone seeking quality cuisine in a cozy setting.\n\nReservations strongly recommended. Open Tuesday-Sunday, 5:30 PM - 10:00 PM.",
